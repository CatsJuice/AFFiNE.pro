If you want to get more info, you can watch the video.Roughly includes the following pointsï¼š\n\n1. Rust and NAPI-RS are being used to rewrite many front-end tools, mainly performance-sensitive libraries, to replace original JavaScript components.\n1. NAPI-RS can handle more complex scenarios, such as building plugin APIs to process source code and returning a promise.\n1. The security issues, debugging problems, and overhead costs of NAPI-RS.\n\n![ZuiF4LEeBKFrCBtvJFLzkkHB7MXod9coTlqEMtc4odE=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspace/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blob/ZuiF4LEeBKFrCBtvJFLzkkHB7MXod9coTlqEMtc4odE=)\n\n[Click here to view the speech video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXCMP0T0QOE)\n\nSpecial thanks to Supabase for co-organizing and engineers.sg for filming the video.\n\n\n![LFvhEKKKntNOLPn4CfOCwJ31vq6hk0R16Nf4sLU9nUM=](https://app.affine.pro/api/workspace/H6vffRmJbCfA-r3kq_36_/blob/LFvhEKKKntNOLPn4CfOCwJ31vq6hk0R16Nf4sLU9nUM=)\n\nAs a dedicated advocate of open-source, AFFiNE strives to foster connections with developers worldwide.
